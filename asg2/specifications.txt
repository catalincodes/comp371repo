== SPECIFICATIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT 2 == 

Notes from description:

learn about Catmull-Rom splines and basic model animation. 

develop application in OpenGL
take as input a set of control points
create a cubic Catmull-Rom spline
draw a 3D object moving along spline

-- part 1 --

create a GLFW window , size - 800 x 800
use ortho projection (how?) (initialize)
click on a number of points
	get info from mouse
	add info to a vector of positions (x,y) objects update the vertex shader every time.

Step 1: initialize (self-defined function)
Step 2: do-while loop #1, loop until enter is pressed
Step 3: render spline (STAGE 2)
Step 4: draw triangle and move it along  


Questions: 
- can we send over and over again the information to the card using the VertexAtribPointer so that I can add elements to the vector and draw them?
