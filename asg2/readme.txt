Program is an OpenGL application that draws a CatMull-Rom spline and animates
triangle that follows along the spline. The program is compatible with 
OpenGL 3.0 and higher.


3) Features

 - read points from the user through mouse clicks
 - capable of rendering a spline when 4 or more points are given by the user
 - clears the screen if the user provided wrong input

 generated by the program based on the points given by the user
 - application is able to hand any window rezise events
